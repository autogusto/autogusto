<hgroup class="speech-bubble">
  <p style = "color:black; font-family:verdana;">Ariel, you have worked on diverse projects around the topic of listening -either in urban or rather isolated natural surroundings. During your residency at Aalto University Helsinki for example, you constructed a complex public architecture in the centre of the city that could be experienced as a sculpture, but that was in fact built for entering and having intimate, self-reflexive conversations around the question, Why Do We Do the Things We Do?. During your time here at Platform 12, you constructed another conversation room which had a completely different shape, as well as a new concept behind. Can you tell me a bit more about your initial idea behind "Conversation Room" at Bosch and how if differs from your previous project in Finland?.</p>

<hgroup class="speech-bubble2">
  <p style = "color:white; font-family:verdana;">Considering the fact that the conversation partners normally work in very rational and production-oriented contexts, this setup must have been rather unusual for them. How did the people react to your invitation? Didnâ€™t they first doubt or mistrust you when being introduced to Conversation Room?
